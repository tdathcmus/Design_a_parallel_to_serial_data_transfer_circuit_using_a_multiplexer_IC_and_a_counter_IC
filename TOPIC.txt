Design a parallel-to-serial data transfer circuit using a multiplexer IC and a counter IC.

Description:

There are 8 data input lines designed using switches.
There is 1 output LED to indicate the signal.
The circuit allows for data transfer.
There is an LED to indicate the clock pulse frequency.
Students are required to design a pulse generation circuit
